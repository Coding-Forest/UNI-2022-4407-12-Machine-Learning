### Confidence intervals

_Standard errors can be used to compute confidence intervals. A 95 % confidence interval confidence interval is defined as a range of values such that with 95 % probability, the range will contain the true unknown value of the parameter._ (James et al. 2021)

### Concepts 

- Linearity vs Non-linearity
- Polynomial relationships
- Non-parametric relationships

### Parametric learning

- _Assumptions can greatly simplify the learning process, but can also limit what can be learned. Algorithms that simplify the function to a known form are called parametric machine learning algorithms._
- _Algorithms that do not make strong assumptions about the form of the mapping function are called nonparametric machine learning algorithms. By not making assumptions, they are free to learn any functional form from the training data._ (Brownlee, 2020)

### Colinearity 

- a situation in which two or more predictor variables are closely related to each other.
